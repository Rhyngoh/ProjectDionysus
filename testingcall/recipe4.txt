Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.</li><li>Next, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.</li><li>Cut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li><li>NOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.</li><li>*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.</li><li>**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.</li></ol>"~"African Chicken Peanut Stew"|"http://www.afrolems.com/2014/03/18/african-chicken-peanut-stew-recipe/"|"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/african-chicken-peanut-stew-716268.jpg"|"Seasoning,Bell Peppers for garnishing,1.5 Cups of Chopped Chicken,2.5 Cooking spoons of oil,1 teaspoon of Curry,2 garlic cloves,Small piece of Chopped ginger,1 Cup of groundnut (Blended) or 1 Cooking spoon of peanut Butter,2 handfuls of Chopped onions,Pepper,Salt,1/2 small sweet potato (Chopped),Pinch of thyme,1 Chopped small tomato,1.5 Cooking spoons of Blended tomato"|"bbq seasoning,bell peppers,chicken,cooking oil,curry paste,garlic cloves,ginger,groundnut,onions,pepper,salt,sweet potato,thyme,tomato,tomato"|"Season and Boil the Chicken for 10 minutes with salt, pepper, seasoning, a handful of onions.Once the chicken is ready, in the same stock, Boil the chopped sweet potatoes till its almost cooked.
