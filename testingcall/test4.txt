Serving any sooner may give you a soupy, but still delicious dinner."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":14,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/68PX6QXK/german-rhubarb-cake-with-meringue","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/german-rhubarb-cake-with-meringue-644488","aggregateLikes":15,"spoonacularScore":47,"creditText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","extendedIngredients":[{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg","name":"almonds","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"sliced almonds for topping","metaInformation":["sliced","for topping"]},{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":100,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1/3 cup 1 1/2 Tablespoon (100 g) butter, unsalted and at room temp.","metaInformation":["unsalted"]},{"id":1124,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg","name":"egg whites","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 egg whites","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 large eggs","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":150,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1 1/4 cup (150 g) flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9307,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rhubarb.jpg","name":"rhubarb","amount":600,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"21 ounces (600 g) rhubarb, peeled and cubed","metaInformation":["cubed","peeled"]},{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg","name":"roasted almonds","amount":50,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1 3/4 ounces (50 g) roasted almonds, ground","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1.75,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 3/4 cups Salt (sack salt, not Iodized)","metaInformation":["(sack salt, not Iodized)"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup SUGAR, BROWN, 2 LB","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":5,"unit":"ml","unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters","originalString":"1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":644488,"title":"German Rhubarb Cake with Meringue","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/German-Rhubarb-Cake-with-Meringue-644488.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["german","european"],"dishTypes":["dessert"],"pricePerServing":119.17,"instructions":"<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350F Convection.

Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the the mixture begins to thicken and then simmer lightly until thickened. Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

Add a little water if necessary. Cover and set aside while you prepare the rest of the food.Now prepare the sauce. Whisk together all of the ingredients and set aside.For the filling, combine the carrot, radish, green onions, green chilies and snow peas. Put the herbs in another bowl and have your sprouts ready along with the mushrooms.Heat a teaspoon of oil over medium heat in a non-stick skillet. When hot, ladle 1/2 cup of batter into the pan and spread with the bottom of the ladle until you have a roughly 6 to 8 inch pancake.  Fry for 6 to 8 minutes or until you have small holes forming and the bottom is crispy brown, then flip and fry for another few minutes on the other side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in a 150 oven while you finish the rest of the pancakes  you should finish with 4 to 6 pancakes.To serve, scatter a portion of the vegetables, herbs and mushrooms over one half of the pancake. Sprinkle some sauce over top and fold the pancake. Drizzle with more sauce and there you go."},{"vegetarian":true,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":14,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":12,"sourceUrl":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/68PX6QXK/german-rhubarb-cake-with-meringue","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/german-rhubarb-cake-with-meringue-644488","aggregateLikes":15,"spoonacularScore":47,"creditText":"Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit","license":"CC BY 3.0","sourceName":"Foodista","extendedIngredients":[{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg","name":"almonds","amount":12,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"sliced almonds for topping","metaInformation":["sliced","for topping"]},{"id":18371,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-powder.jpg","name":"baking powder","amount":2,"unit":"teaspoons","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"2 teaspoons baking powder","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1001,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/butter-sliced.jpg","name":"butter","amount":100,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1/3 cup 1 1/2 Tablespoon (100 g) butter, unsalted and at room temp.","metaInformation":["unsalted"]},{"id":1124,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg-white.jpg","name":"egg whites","amount":3,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"3 egg whites","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 large eggs","metaInformation":["large"]},{"id":20081,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/flour.png","name":"flour","amount":150,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1 1/4 cup (150 g) flour","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9307,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/rhubarb.jpg","name":"rhubarb","amount":600,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"21 ounces (600 g) rhubarb, peeled and cubed","metaInformation":["cubed","peeled"]},{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/almonds.jpg","name":"roasted almonds","amount":50,"unit":"g","unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams","originalString":"1 3/4 ounces (50 g) roasted almonds, ground","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1.75,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1 3/4 cups Salt (sack salt, not Iodized)","metaInformation":["(sack salt, not Iodized)"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cup","originalString":"1 cup SUGAR, BROWN, 2 LB","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla extract","amount":5,"unit":"ml","unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters","originalString":"1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract","metaInformation":[]}],"id":644488,"title":"German Rhubarb Cake with Meringue","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/German-Rhubarb-Cake-with-Meringue-644488.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":["german","european"],"dishTypes":["dessert"],"pricePerServing":119.17,"instructions":"<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350F Convection.

Preheat oven to 350. Cream butter and sugar together in your mixer, scraping the sides of your bowl. Add your egg and mix well. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, Kool-Aid and cornstarch. Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these!

Add a little bit of olive oil to your frying pan, add chicken, and cook through. Remove chicken from pan, then add diced onions to the pan. Turn heat to medium and let onions saute through. (You may need to add a little bit more oil to the pan.)</li><li>Meanwhile, chop up your chicken (or shred) very finely. When the onions are soft and translucent, add chicken back to the pan. Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.</li><li>Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.</li><li>If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag. When you want to make them, simply line them up again on a greased cookie sheet, let thaw for about an hour on the counter, then bake as instructed.)</li><li>Now, bake your enchiladas in the oven, at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes. They should be lightly browned. Remove them from the oven and spoon over about 2TBSP of your enchilada sauce over the top of each enchilada. Then sprinkle the tops with cheese. Put the enchiladas back in the oven for about 7 minutes. After that, it's time to eat!</li></ol>"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":false,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":25,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"servings":2,"sourceUrl":"http://www.pinkwhen.com/easy-bread-pudding-recipe/","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/easy-bread-pudding-and-vans-715508","aggregateLikes":45,"spoonacularScore":37,"creditText":"Jen West","license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","sourceName":"Pink When","extendedIngredients":[{"id":2010,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/cinnamon.jpg","name":"cinnamon","amount":0.25,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoons","originalString":"¼ tsp cinnamon","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1123,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/egg.jpg","name":"eggs","amount":2,"unit":"","unitShort":"","unitLong":"","originalString":"2 eggs","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1034053,"aisle":"Oil, Vinegar, Salad Dressing","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/olive-oil.jpg","name":"extra virgin olive oil","amount":2,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"extra virgin olive oil","metaInformation":[]},{"id":1049,"aisle":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/fluid-cream.jpg","name":"half and half","amount":1.5,"unit":"cups","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1½ cups half and half","metaInformation":[]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"natural sugar","amount":1,"unit":"box","unitShort":"box","unitLong":"box","originalString":"1 box Van's Gluten Free Totally Natural Waffles","metaInformation":["gluten free"]},{"id":19336,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/powdered-sugar.jpg","name":"powdered sugar","amount":1,"unit":"Tbsp","unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp","originalString":"1 Tbsp powdered sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2047,"aisle":"Spices and Seasonings","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/salt.jpg","name":"salt","amount":1,"unit":"pinch","unitShort":"pinch","unitLong":"pinch","originalString":"pinch of salt","metaInformation":[]},{"id":9316,"aisle":"Produce","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/strawberries.png","name":"strawberries","amount":0.5,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"½ cup fresh strawberries, mashed","metaInformation":["fresh","mashed"]},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/sugar-cubes.jpg","name":"sugar","amount":0.3333333333333333,"unit":"cup","unitShort":"c","unitLong":"cups","originalString":"1/3 cup sugar","metaInformation":[]},{"id":2050,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/vanilla-extract.jpg","name":"vanilla","amount":1,"unit":"tsp","unitShort":"t","unitLong":"teaspoon","originalString":"1 tsp vanilla","metaInformation":[]},{"id":10019087,"aisle":"Baking","image":"https://spoonacular.com/cdn/ingredients_100x100/white-chocolate-chips.jpg","name":"white chocolate chips","amount":2,"unit":"servings","unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings","originalString":"White chocolate chips","metaInformation":["white"]}],"id":715508,"title":"Easy Bread Pudding and Vans","readyInMinutes":45,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/easy-bread-pudding-and-vans-715508.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["dessert"],"pricePerServing":146.01,"instructions":"Toast waffles according to the package.
