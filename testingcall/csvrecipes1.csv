Pour the celery/onion mixture over all and gently toss, adding additional broth to moisten the bread. Use caution to not break up the bread cubes. The cubes should be almost moistened through, but not soaking wet.</li><li>Butter a shallow baking dish with half of the remaining butter and place the stuffing in the middle. Dot the top of the stuffing with any remaining butter. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven.</li><li>In the meantime, pat the chops dry with a paper towel and season on both sides with salt and pepper.

The chops will still be nearly raw in the center.</li><li>Remove the foil from the precooked stuffing and place the chops in a single layer over the stuffing. Return to the oven and roast for aprox 15-25 minutes, uncovered (depending on the thickness of your chops).  The chops should be cooked until the no longer dark pink inside, but still moist and juicy, but not overcooked. Remove from the oven and serve.</li></ol>
Caldo Verde - Portuguese Kale Soup^http://www.foodista.com/recipe/7SDK7CGK/caldo-verde-portuguese-kale-soup^https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Caldo-Verde---Portuguese-Kale-Soup-636787.jpg^3 carrots peeled and sliced,4 cups of chicken stock,2 chorizo links,3 garlic cloves smashed,1 bunch of kale julienned,1/2 large onion chopped,4 large yellow potatoes chopped,crushed red pepper flakes,salt and pepper to taste,2 cups of water^carrots,chicken stock,chorizo,garlic cloves,kale,onion,potatoes,red pepper flakes,salt and pepper,water^<ol><li>Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.</li><li>Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.</li><li>Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.</li><li>Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.</li><li>Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.</li><li>Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.</li><li>Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.</li><li>In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.</li><li>Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.</li><li>Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.</li><li>With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.</li><li>Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.</li><li>Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!</li></ol>

Vegetarian Chinese Pot Stickers^http://www.foodista.com/recipe/KF58KP4Y/vegan-vegetarian-pot-stickers^https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Vegetarian-Chinese-Pot-Stickers-664650.jpg^A little cornstarch,1 tsp. grated fresh ginger,1 tsp. fresh garlic (pressed through a garlic press),8 oz. mushrooms (your choice – I used half whites & half baby portobellos),2 scallions, white & green parts, roughly chopped,1 Tbs. tamari or soy sauce,1 tsp. sriracha hot sauce,A little vegetable oil,1 cup water, divided,24 won ton wrappers^cornstarch,fresh ginger,garlic,mushrooms,scallions,soy sauce,sriracha hot sauce,vegetable oil,water,won ton wrappers^<ol><li>Add all of the ingredients (except the wrappers, cornstarch, oil, and water) to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms.</li><li>Place a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.</li><li>Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.</li><li>Dip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.</li><li>Stand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)</li><li>Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.</li><li>*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes.</li></ol>
