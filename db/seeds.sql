Turn upside down and squeeze the cloves out of the garlic skin Whole Wheat Pizza Dough Instructions: Place all ingredients (except 2 tbsp olive oil) in a food processor or a stand mixer with dough hook. If using a food processor, process until dough forms into a ball. Add extra water, 1 tbsp at a time if dough is too dry. If using a stand mixer, mix with dough hook until all of the flour is mixed together. If you have time, place dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Lightly flour surface and roll dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. I chose to use a large bowl and cut out circular pizzas. This required me to roll the dough out three times, making 2 larger pizzas and one smaller one. You could also opt to roll it out until it is a rectangle. Place pizza on pizza stone or on greased cookie sheet. Set aside. Brush pizza dough lightly with olive oil (no more than 2 tbsp total). Pizza Topping Instructions: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray. Place cubed red onion and sweet potato on the sheet. Drizzle with 1-2 tbsp olive oil, and sprinkle with thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Roast for 25-30 minutes, mixing the vegetables around occasionally. (I roasted my garlic at the same time). Remove and set aside. Take your freshly roasted bulb of garlic and squeeze the garlic out into a mortar bowl (if you don't have one, use a bowl). Crush the garlic with either a pestle or the bottom of a spoon until it is a paste. Spread the roasted garlic paste over the pizza dough. Sprinkle/crumble your cheese of choice over the pizza dough. Place the vegetables on top of the cheese. Cook pizza for approximately 20 minutes (plus or minus a few minutes depending on your oven), waiting for the crust to become golden brown. Enjoy!"),
